<h1>DD1351 - Logic for Computer Scientist</h1>

<p>
Repository for the course Logic for Computer Scientists - DD1351. In this course, we covered topics in mathematical logic and computer science, including propositional and predicate logic, Prolog, inductive proofs, temporal logic, and Hoare logic. I learned to specify and prove properties of mathematical-logical structures and program properties. The assessment included homework, quizzes, and lab work. The main focus of the labs was to solve different problems using Prolog, such as verifying a proof in predicate logic. This repository contains the code for all the labs.
