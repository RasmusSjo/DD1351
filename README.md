<h1>DD1351 - Logic for Computer Scientist</h1>

Repository for the course Logic for Computer Scientists - DD1351.

<h2>Course summary</h2>

<p>
In this course, we covered topics in mathematical logic and computer science, including propositional and predicate logic, Prolog, inductive proofs, temporal logic, and Hoare logic. I learned to specify and prove properties of mathematical-logical structures and program properties. The assessment included homework, quizzes, and lab work. The main focus of the labs was to solve different problems using Prolog, such as verifying a proof in predicate logic. This repository contains the code for all the labs.

<h2>Folder structure</h2>

<p>
  There were three labs in the course, and the folders "lab 1-3" correspond to these. The instructions for each lab are contained within a PDF in each folder.

  Lab 1 - introductory exercises to learn the basics of the Prolog language. Each file in the folder corresponds to one of the lab exercises.
  Lab 2 - a natural deduction proof checker. The proof checker can be found in the "verify.pl" file. Any tests can be found either directly in the folder or in the subfolder "tests".
  Lab 3 - a model checker for temporal logic CTL. The model checker can be found in the "verify.pl" file.
